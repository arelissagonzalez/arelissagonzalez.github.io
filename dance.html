<h2>My Passion for Dance</h2>
<div>
<p>
I have been dancing recreationally ever since I was two years old. I have always felt a passion for dancing. It is always an escape for me. when I first started dancing, I took ballet, tap, and jazz. I now take contemporary, which is a more modern version of ballet. I like to dance because I think it is a fun way to be active and to let loose.
