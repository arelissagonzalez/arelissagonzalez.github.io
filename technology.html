<p>
Technology has been important throughout most of my life. During my freshman year of high school, I had gotten more involved with computers and with technology. I had been shown many things that could be done with computers and various forms of technology. I then became interested in how technology could be used along with medicine. I love to explore many things having to do with technology.
