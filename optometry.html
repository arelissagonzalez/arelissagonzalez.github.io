<h2>My Passion for Optometry</h2>

<div>
<p>
	Since I was little, I have always wanted to be in the field of Optometry. My mom, a graduate of Barnard, started her career as an Optometrist (eye doctor) in 1991. I share a passion and an interest with her. We both are fascinated by the human eye and the many things that can be found while examining it.
